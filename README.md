# Shoot-Zombies-In-City
A low-poly styled FPS game made with Unity

## How to play
Just download the game from [here (a release version)](https://www.google.com), extract the file and run.

## Control
All the control mappings are the same as classical FPS games
  * `WASD` to move 
  * `R` to reload
  * `Space` to jump
  * `Left Mouse Button` to shoot
  * `RIght Mouse Button` to aim

## Mechanism
Endless zombies will be generated to the scene. Shoot their heads to kill them and the damage will decrease greatly when shoot the other parts. The game time and score (simply the zombies killed) will be displayed. Once the character is touched by any zombie the game will end.

## Note
This game was designed in order to take 4 main factors of a game into practice. So the content may be deficient. All the models within the game was from existing unitypackage and I implemented most of the logics.
